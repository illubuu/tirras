The Essence of Four is the name for the four major aspects of Good and Evil, locked in eternal conflict to maintain [[The Primordials#The Void|balance]]. These are comprised of the four Grand Seraphim of the Celestials and the four Archdevils of the Fires, pure and unaltered manifestations of the Moral Scale. 

## Grand Seraphim

The Grand Seraphim were the four 'leaders' of the Celestial Pantheon. They were created as an opposing force to the Archdevils and, after having banished said Archdevils from the Physical Plane, they allowed themselves to be destroyed, their bones then becoming the [[Seraphim]], which continue to do battle with the Devils into the present. Each living Seraph is a descendent of one of these four, and any of their [[Nephilin|children]] onwards. The four beings that made up this leadership are: 


## Archdevils

The Archdevils are the four most powerful [[Devils]] that exist within the [[Lower Planes|Lyzsn Fires]]. They were originally acting generals to the legions of devils, born from ???? until the Grand Seraphim tore them from the world and cast them where they could no longer interfere. The four Archdevils are:
