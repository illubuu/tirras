The Council is the acting ruling body for the Gods that inhabit Tirras Savehys. 
## The Nine

"The Nine" is a colloquial term for the nine reigning Gods. They are the heads of the main jurisdictions that rule life within the land, and the major ruling body for the happenings on the astral and physical planes. Most mortals are aware of the existence of the nine, however the Gods' interactions with mortals is usually quite rare. It is an individual choice of the deity to get involved with the lives of mortals, and most stay within the astral plane to avoid conflict with [[The Primordials#The Void|Balance]].

Each of the Nine represent one of the eight [[Magic Disciplines]], save for [[Mahys]] and [[Styvel]] who come from the same [[Dies Lin Du Forest|Spigot]]. 
## Functions

The Council functions as a democratic body that votes together to make decisions for the planes. These are often rulings regarding the introduction of lesser Gods into the pantheon, or disputes between deities. While land claims are left to the Nine, smaller jurisdictional claims are allowed for the lesser Gods, such as castles or landmarks. These claims are equally put forth before the Council to ensure border conflicts do not arise, and that they do not affect the mortals living within those regions.  

And while acting as the decision arm, the Council is also the enforcement arm of their decisions. Should a God act [[Rogue Gods|out of order]], or defy such an order from the Nine, the Council has the power to strip lesser Gods of their godhood and return them to [[Wandering Essence]], unable to reconvene with anything else and banished to wander the lands without purpose or power. 
## Lesser Gods

Lesser Gods are the term for any godly being that is created that is **not** one of the Nine. This moniker does not speak to a Gods power or ability, simply that they are not one of the founding Gods.
