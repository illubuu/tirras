## Jurisdiction

> *"Lihsek is the God of the Elements, twin brother to Idallouse. He presides over Water, Air, and Metal. He is the Commander who walks amongst his men, and the bond born between brothers of the field. He is the low burning candles in crowded tents, and the breeze that rustles banners held high. His domain is filled with broken shields and polished steel, overflowing cups of ale and leather coated in campfire smoke. His existence calls to the camaraderie between those who fight, and that strength of the whole comes only from the unity of its pieces."*
