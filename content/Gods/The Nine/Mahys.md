## Jurisdiction

>*Mahys is the God of Necromancy, twin sister to Styvel. She presides over Life, the restful and ever present wonder and whimsy of existence. She, along with her sister, is the being that carries the souls of the deceased through the strange realm of the Overlay and peacefully into the Echo Lands. While Styvel tends to the soul and spirit of the dead, Mahys tends to those left behind. She is the happy memories that come to mind on calm summer days, and the familiar smell of those once loved. She is the tears of love yet to be shared, of affection with nowhere to go. Her domain is filled with sunlight and slumber, comfort and care. Her existence calls to the love of Life, even if it must one day end.*
