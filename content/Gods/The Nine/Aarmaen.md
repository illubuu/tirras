## Jurisdiction

>*Aarmaen is the God of Aethery. She is a rather unknown God, a mystery to even the Council of Nine themselves. She presides over the healing disciplines, the candles lit in windows to signal a safe place to come to. Her domain is filled with late nights and longer mornings, of spilled bottles and torn rags. She watches over the sick and needy, a reminder for community in caring for those in need. Her existence calls to the connection of all that Lives, Has Lived, and Will Live. Life is not a single entity, but a flowing, moving current through all things.*\
