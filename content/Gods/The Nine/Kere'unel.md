## Jurisdiction

>*Kere'unel is the God of Selucory. She presides over the worldly parts of life, of travel and discovery. She is the sound of dirt beneath well-worn boots and the smell of aged parchment from unrolled maps. She is the match lit to read by candlelight, and hunger the drives the search for even the most elusive answers. Her domain is an inviting, cluttered place filled with books and models and diagrams, a show for the wonder of the physical world. Her existence calls to the wanderlust of restless hearts, the curiosity born from the desire to understand, and the call of the open road in every form.*
