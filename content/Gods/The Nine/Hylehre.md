## Jurisdiction

>*Hylehre is the God of Lexicory. She presides over the grand and heroic, the legends and tales that speak of places and people long gone. She is fiercely protective, blade and board in hand to protect that which is held dear. She is the breath before the charge, the first and last words of the mighty hero, the pounding heart that sits snug in a warriors chest. Brave and bold, her domain is filled with tapestries and tomes, the power of the written word on the mind of a mortal. Her existence calls to the protection and remembrance of all that is worth saving, and standing proud in the face of impossible odds.*
