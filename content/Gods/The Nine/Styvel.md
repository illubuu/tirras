## Jurisdiction

> *Styvel is the God of Necromancy, twin sister to Mahys. She presides over Death, the ever present partner to Life, and - along with her sister - the being that carries the souls of the deceased through the strange realm of the Overlay and peacefully into the Echo Lands. While Mahys tends to those left behind, Styvel ensures the recently passed are able to cross peacefully. She is the restful contentedness that comes with one's Final Rest, the peace of the heart and mind. Her domain is filled with companionship, the love that carries over from one life to the next, the little things that fill memories. Her existence calls for not a fear of Death, but for the Celebration of having Lived.*
