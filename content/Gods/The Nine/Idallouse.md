## Jurisdiction

>*Idallouse is the God of the Elements, twin brother to Lihsek. He presides over Fire, Earth, and Lightning. He is the roar of a victorious crowd, and the rush pride that comes only from the hands of triumph. He is the glint in the scepter held by the King, the swell of hardy celebration until the latest hours of evening. His domain flows with mead and ale, with music that never ends, with raucous gaiety that all might enjoy. His existence calls to the pride in one's accomplishments, the ambition to go forth and conquer all of one's potential, and the desire to lead to the grandest of paths.*
