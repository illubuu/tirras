## Jurisdiction 

>*Fhewhas is the God of Phrenory, twin brother of Verdihsil. He presides over the mind. He is the spirit of innovation, of surpassing the limits set by others in order to achieve the greatest of possibilities.  He is the sacrifices made in the name of progress, the midnight oil burned for days on end, the unyielding want to carve a name into the pages of history.  His domain is gilded and glittering, high atop the mountains, a testament to the superiority over all others and all else. His existence calls to the selfish drive that often precedes the greater good, the internal desires that drive external change.*
