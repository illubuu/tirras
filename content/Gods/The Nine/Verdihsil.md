## Jurisdiction

>*Verdihsil is the God of Anti-Magic, twin brother to Fhewhas. He presides over the mundane. He is the rigid discipline set to ensure balance, the silence that is stronger than spoken word. He is the traditions passed down amongst families from ages passed, the refusal to bend against which is firmly held in the heart, and the courage to stand steadfast in the even the most disruptive chaos. He is the sound of whispers amongst clandestine hunters, the time spent to ensure there are no mistakes, the conviction to do what needs to be done. His domain is organized, decorated spartanly with attention to both form and function, hidden in plain sight. His existence calls to the need for temperance and control over oneself, and the need for utter surety in all that is done.*
