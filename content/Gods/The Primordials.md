The Primordials are the most Basic of the entities that exist in Tirras Savehys. They are cosmic in nature, encompassing all that existence is, was, and will be. They are the creators of existence, eternal, until everything ceases to exist.

## Aether

The Aether is the Primordial that represents the *positive* flow of energy in the world. The energy of creation and the future. Of things that will be.

## Nether

The Nether is the Primordial represents the *negative* flow of energy in the world. The energy of destruction and the past. Of the things that were.

## The Void

The Void is the most unknown and least physical of any of the primordial entities. They represent Balance in its purest form, and exist in essence to embody everything that is Not, while still occupying the smallest part of time - the present.

>*There is nothing here. Not Death, nor Life. Just simple non-existence. A place outside of time where you will find naught but eternal Emptiness.*
