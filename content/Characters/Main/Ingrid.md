### Early Years

Born and raised to be an [[Oudinnen#Ashnetaniss - the Lore Keepers|Ashnetaniss]], Ingrid saw none of the surface world during her childhood and much of her adulthood. Taken to live at the [[Has'jhinse#Plelshen Palace|Plelshen Palace]], she saw very little of her family, with much of her interaction being with the other three current Ashnetaniss'. These three women became surrogate mothers for the young girl, teaching her the ways of the world and the ways of their particular type of memory magic.
