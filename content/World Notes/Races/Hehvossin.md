The Hehvossin are a race of ungulates that then fall into into two categories: **centaurs** & **fauns**. They can take on the characteristics of most any hooved animal, though horses and deer are the most common. Centuars are a [[Fae|Fae-touched]] species, resulting in many theories that they are a direct result of the meddling between [[Neylvishen]] and the animals of the Fae Woods of [[Garstindada Forest]]. 
## Fauns

Fauns are the most common type of hehvossin, distinguished by their bipedal nature. They often sport the ears, horns, legs, and tails of the species they most resemble. This, however, is not a hard or fast rule, and hehvossin that have multiple types in their family tree might have minor mixing of the traits.

## Centaurs

Centaurs are far more rare than their faun cousins, occurring in only about 0.8% of hehvossin births. Only centaurs mothers can give birth to centaur children. While their bottom halves can be most any ungulate, the top half is almost always [[Neylvishen|Neylvish]] in appearance.
