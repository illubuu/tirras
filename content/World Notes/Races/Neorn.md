The Neorn are an race of near-elves that were ruled extinct after the [[Great Catastrophe]] that reset the world back to its beginnings. Their spigot was the [[Myoh Lake Oasis]] and their patron God was [[Fhewhas]]. 

All that is known of their people is they were once the heads of a [[Ancient Kingdom|massive world-spanning empire]] that eventually collapsed and took the world with it.
