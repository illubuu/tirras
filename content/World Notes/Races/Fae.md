The Fae are one of the old races, having been created at the beginning of the world by the [[The Primordials#Aether|Aether]]. They were once one of the dominant races, alongside the [[Dragons]] until the birth of the new races. Their hubris would lead to the [[The Primordials#The Void|Void]] banishing them to their homeland of the [[Labyrinthine Greens]].
