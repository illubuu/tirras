The Dnoden are the canine race that are often noted for their high energy and fierce determination. They and the [[Chichee]] are considered "tether races", in that they seemed to have developed alongside each other and share many cultural aspects, traditions, and celebrations with each other. Their spigot is the [[Dies Lin Du Forest]].
