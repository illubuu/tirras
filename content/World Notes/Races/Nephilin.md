The Nephilin are a race of individuals that are bound to and protected by a [[Seraphim#Guardians|Celestial Guardian]]. They are considered a 'subrace' in that they can be attached to any of the other races and are not limited to any one type.

The number of Nephilin in existence fluctuates based on the influence of [[Devils]] on the [[Physical Plane]] at any given time. An individual might not know they even have a Guardian until the time comes that they are needed, where at the Seraphim will make themselves known.
