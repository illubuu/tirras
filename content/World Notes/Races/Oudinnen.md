The Oudinnen are a race of near-elves that are the distant ancestors to the ancient [[Neorn]] People who were eradicated during the [[Great Catastrophe]]. 
### Origins

The Oudinnen are a product of the refuge Neorn People who attempted to escape the Ancient Kingdom after the Great Catastrophe decimated not only their home, but the world at large. Of the few who escaped, they made their way through the [[The Underground|labrythine tunnels]] meant the transport goods from the Kingdom lands to those of the rest of the Empire. They set up their home here to escape the wild of the lands above and, slowly over time, became their own distinct race.

### Ashnetaniss - the Lore Keepers

The Oudinnen are guided, advised, and ruled by a group of three women knows as the Ashnetaniss. Meaning 'wearer of lace', these woman are in charge of guiding the People into the future by use of their memory magic given to them by [[Fhewhas]].
