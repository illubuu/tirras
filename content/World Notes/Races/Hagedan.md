The Hagedon are the lizard race that inhabit the arid/desert regions and the humid marshlands of Tirras Savehys. They, along with the [[Teeypen]], are among the shortest lived races with an average age of 85. This race is divided into two types: **amphibious** and **non-amphibious**. 
## Amphibious

The amphibious Hagedon are prominent in the swampy and marshy areas around [[Ki Tai Lake]], the [[Pos Par Gulf]], and [[Grans Gulf.]] These individuals are among the few that have functioning lungs and gills (other than the select few [[Chitin types]]). They often take jobs that their unique biology allows them to have a monopoly over. They are recognized by the elaborate scarves and neck wraps they wear to protect their gills. 
## Non-Amphibious

The non-amphibious Hagedon, also called the Ariddian, are prominent in the hot, desert regions of [[Tzk Tzyl]], [[Frieburn]], and the edges of the [[World Notes/Places/World Locations/Regions/Burnt Lands|Burnt Lands]]. Unlike many of the other races that inhabit the desert regions, the Hagedon don't wear much of any clothing. Their tough outer skin is unaffected by the sun and actually needs sunlight for the Ariddian metabolism to function.
