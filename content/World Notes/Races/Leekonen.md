The leekonen are a race of short humanoids that are then divided into five groupings: **the gibbish, the gobbish, the dundur, the slipset and the mouren.** Their spigot is [[Lake Ailmed]]. 
## The Gibbish

The **Gibbish** are the leekonen from the marshlands around the [[Kurbn Sea]] and the [[Pos Par Gulf]]. They are experts at sailing and water travel and speak with a particular 'twang' in their speech. They are often found in port cities playing their unique short necked bubble flutes. 
## The Gobbish

The **Gobbish** are an offshoot of the Gibbish that have left the ports entirely and move their entire lives out to sea. They are quickly distinguished by their swirling tattoo patterns done in bright white and gold ink.
## The Dundur

The **Dundur** are the leekonen that live in the mountainous and steppe regions of the northern [[The Great Plains|Plains]] and [[Dian Pohnas]]. They are known for their extensive clothing designs, from their massive herds of wool producing steeds and renowned horsemanship. 
## The Slipset

The **Slipset** are the group that originated in the deep forested regions, such as the [[Meshtean Forest]] that dominate the [[Middle Grounds]], the [[Garstindada Forest]] in the eastern [[Winter Woodlands]], and [[Sha Woods]] in [[Dian Pohnas]]. They are skilled hunters, and are noted for their craftsmanship with wood and natural fibers, such as tallis weeds they turn into decorative jewelry.
## The Mouren

The **Mouren** are the leekonen of the hot and arid regions of [[Frieburn]] and [[Tzk Tzyl]]. Their culture circles around horse racing (unlike dundur horsemanship) and cooling milk based drinks. Their clothing is often fashioned from a single piece of fabric (as cloth is difficult to make in the desert).
