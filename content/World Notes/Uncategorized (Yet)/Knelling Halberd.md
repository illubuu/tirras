The signature weapon of [[Essence of Four#Archdevils#Death|Amenn, second Archdevil, Lord of Death]].

This halberd is incredibly tall, standing as long as two men stood atop each other from one end to the other, intending to evoke feelings of fear and domination. The shape of the blade is of a crescent moon, meant to mock [[Styvel]] and her claim as night as her domain.
