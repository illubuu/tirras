The Seraph's Bane is a special blade made from the flesh and blood of fallen [[Seraphim|Seraphim]]. 

Once thought to be only legend thrown about by [[Devils]] wanting to impart fear, it was discovered to have been a real item held by [[Layleth]], last of the Grandorian Empire, and was instrumental in the fall of the Empire and the [[Great Catastrophe]].
