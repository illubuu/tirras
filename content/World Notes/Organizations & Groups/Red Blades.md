The Red Blades are a large network of mercenaries that act against the [[Seraphim]] and [[Nephilin]] communities, attempting to eradicate them entirely. 

## History

The Red Blades began with a [[Leekonen]] woman named Hester Yewblane. Born in 278 D 1E in the small farming village of [[The Great Plains#Blaen|Blaen]], Hester was raised in a family of farmers. When she was twelve, she took the long trip with her father to the city of [[The Great Plains#Edelsburg|Edelsberg]] to sell their wares. In the city, she met an older woman that only introduced herself as [[Devils#Cecelia|Cecelia]]. Cecelia was a Devil who had possessed the body of a woman and convinced Hester to take with her a small metal pin that, within it, contained the Devil.
