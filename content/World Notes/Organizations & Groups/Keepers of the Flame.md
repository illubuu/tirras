The Keepers of the Flame are the collection of spellcasters that are desperate to utilize and wield the [[Lower Planes#Lyzsn Fire|Lyzsn Flame]] and the [[Devils]]. They symbol of their organization is a four pointed flame, held by two cupped hands. The flame itself grows from between the hands, representing the birth and growth of the flame by the Keepers. 
## History

The beginning of the Keepers is not well known, as their group is highly secretive, going so far as to murder any members who might go rogue and attempt to leave. There is the generally held belief that the Keepers began shortly after [[The Splintering]], having morphed from the [[The Splintering#The Fellows|Fellows]] after the war. This would explain how mortals would have understood the [[Lower Planes]] well enough to be able to contact the Devils.

Over the past millennia, the Keepers have perfected the art of fashioning Devils into weapons.
