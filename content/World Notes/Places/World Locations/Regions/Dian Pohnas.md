## Culture

Known as **Dianni**, or more colloquially **'Madams' and 'Misters'**, people from this region are often viewed as rigid, though kind. A tough love sort of culture. Society for Diannis is matriarchal, as the named from the ever important Family stems from the mother's line. They are typically the front runners in the fashion scene, setting trends that the rest of society follows. Models, designers, as well as architects, carpenters, and other 'culture creatives' tend to be Dianni, and many of them are women. Dianni families also tend to be large, with multiple children and sometimes multiple spouses, with the goal of ensuring the family line continues and collects as much prestige as possible. There is a pervasive stereotype that Dianni women are conniving and 'ice queens'.
