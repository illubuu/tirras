The Great Plains is a region to the west of the [[Kurbn Peninsula]], north of the [[Winter Woodlands]], and south of [[Tzk Tzyl]] and [[Dian Pohnas]]. 

## Edelsburg

Edelsburg is a major city in the Middle Plains region. It is the manufacturing center, housing many of the factories and plants that construct simple things from showers and children's toys to major ships and carriages. 

## Blaen

Blaen is a small farming village that has existed in the Great Plains since the Great Catastrophe. It maintains itself through a steady supplying of wheat and rye grasses to the much larger cities of Edelsberg and Trefend. Their houses, of which there are few, are still meager huts dug into the soft dirt of the Plains.
