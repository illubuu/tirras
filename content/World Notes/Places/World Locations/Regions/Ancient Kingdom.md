The Ancient Kingdom is the land on the Eastern Continent that was once ruled by the [[Neorn]] People and the home to their massive empire. 

## Early Formation

Not much is known about how the Ancient Kingdom came to be the world spanning empire it was at the time that it fell. The ruins - if there are any left - are hidden beneath the impenetrable [[The Shroud|magic storm]] that hangs over the land. No one has set foot there since the [[Great Catastrophe]] and, thus, much of the history and knowledge of this land is lost to time.
