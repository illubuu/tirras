The Burnt Lands are a mostly desolate land desert with five city-states across the desert landscape. It is also a [[World Notes/Spigots/Burnt Lands|Spigot]], a location of highly concentrated magic. 

## Culture

People from this region are called **Scorch Landers**, or **Scorchies**, often viewed as 'foreigners' even on the proper mainland. They are often eccentric and bold, wearing larger and flashy clothes, usually dominated by the color white; they are loud and not often shy, easily commanding any room they walk into. There is a collective restlessness to those who live in these lands and some venture out from their home as traveling merchants or performers. In major cities it is not uncommon for Scorch Landers to dominate the acting scene, making up majorities in casts, as well as bands and other specialized art shows.  Mages from this region are considered formidable (especially those from the hidden city of Ferris). There is some contention on the global stage as Scorch Landers tend to be grouped into one collective, even through it is made up of five cities, each distinct from each other.
