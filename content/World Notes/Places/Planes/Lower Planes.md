The Lower Planes, known more colloquially as the Lyzsn Fires (the lyzsn or 'fires'), is the land of the [[Devils]]. Stripped from the Circle by [[The Primordials|the Primordials]] as a place 'detached from the world proper', it was originally intended as a place for them to build the world without impacting that which they had already created. However, after the Descent, the Lower Planes became a casting grounds for the Celestials for the invalid and imperfect, that which threatened the balance of life within the other planes (namely the Physical Plane).

While the lands within the Lower Planes are unique to each devil that inhabits it, there are a number a share characteristics between them, namely the flame that appears all throughout and is unique to the plane itself.

### Lyzsn Fire

Lyzsn Fire is a type of fire that only appears on the Lower Planes, and is separate from the fire and flame that appears on the other planes that occupy the world. Labeled a 'governed flame' by [[The Council|the Nine]], the lyzsn fire has a sentient malevolence that it carries within it. Unlike the 'formless fire' of [[Idallouse]] that acts as a part of cycle of renewal, this fire wishes to consume and never return. It is unique to [[Devils]] and those pacted with them. In some reported cases, the flame acts almost as a sickness, spreading its ceaseless hunger to those it encounters.
