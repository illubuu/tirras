The Overlay is not a 'separate' plane in the way the others are. It is attached to the Physical Plane and houses the spirits and souls of the recently deceased. It is only a temporary home for these entities before [[Styvel]] and [[Mahys]] move them into the [[Echo Lands]]. 

When spirit speaking spells or necromancy spells are cast, they draw the spirit back into this 'overlay' to allow communication with the [[Physical Plane]]. Some spirits can get trapped in the Overlay, either by accident ('unfinished business' that can have them corrupted into Tlomen) or by force (necromancy).
