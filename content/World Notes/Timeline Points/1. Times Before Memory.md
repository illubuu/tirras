The Times Before Memory encompass all the time prior to the [[Great Catastrophe]]. Being that the cataclysm destroyed nearly every remnant of these times, there is very little known about it, including who lived during those years, what they did, how they lived, etc. At most, it is known there was an [[Ancient Kingdom]] that ruled over nearly all that is known as Tirras Savehys, and that its destruction ruin the world as they knew it, creating a worldwide reset. 

There were civilizations and history prior to even the [[Ancient Kingdom]], but there is even less about them. Occasionally, there is a discovery that predates the Kingdom and sheds a little light into the shadowed area of time. 

This is also where the myths and legends of prehistory exist:
	when the Gods were formed
	the Creation of [[the Council]]
	the formation of [[Spigots]]
	[[the Splintering]]
