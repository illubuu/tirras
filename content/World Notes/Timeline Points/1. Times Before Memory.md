The Times Before Memory encompass all the time prior to the [[Great Catastrophe]]. Being that the cataclysm destroyed nearly every remnant of these times, there is very little known about it, including who lived during those years, what they did, how they lived, etc. At most, it is known there was an [[Ancient Kingdom]] that ruled over nearly all that is known as Tirras Savehys, and that its destruction had apocalyptic impacts on the world at large, creating a worldwide reset. 

There were civilizations and history prior to even the [[Ancient Kingdom]], as evidenced by a few non-kingdom built structures that survived into the current age, but there is even less known about those people or their culture.

This time period is also where the myths and legends of prehistory originate:
	when the Gods were formed
	the Creation of [[the Council]]
	the formation of [[Spigots]]
	[[the Splintering]]
