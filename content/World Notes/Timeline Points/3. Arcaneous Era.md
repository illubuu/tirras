*2E 708A - 2E 1104A*

The Arcaneous Era marks the period of massive influence by the Arcane, both in the growth of mages, and in the learning of the Spigots and their capabilities. It begins about the same time scholars believe the [[Arcane Explosion]] to have begun and ends when [[the Council]] began to overtake as the dominant magic influence.

[[Yelen Darksun]] was a notable individual during this time, born a little before the Era proper (in 702). He and his husband built the first Arcane University.

It is also during this Era that Lesser Gods began to interact more with mortals, forcing [[the Council|the Nine]] to begin to act as a regulatory body to keep track of them and their pact and influence. Some scholars wonder if these unseen pacts contributed to the Arcane Explosion.
