Seraphim are the beings born of the remains of the Grand Seraphim who destroyed themselves after the [[The Splintering|Splintering]]. Risen from the bones scattered about the world, the Seraphim are part of an eternal and everlasting conflict with [[Devils]], repeating the battles of their forebears.

## Guardians

Guardians are a specific class of Seraphim that have been tied to a [[Nephilin|mortal]] and tasked with aiding and guiding that individual to the greater goal of balance. Unlike the possessions made by Devils, Guardians cannot force their charge to act in any sort of way. Instead, they may only provide advice and guidance, leaving the choice ultimately up to the person. 

Guardians also share their magic and abilities with the individual they are tied to, which includes their wings (the designs are often close in similarity; siblings, not twins) and ability to sense the influence or presence of the [[Lower Planes#Lyzsn Fire|fires]].
