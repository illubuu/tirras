Ghosts are souls with no body or spirit. Because souls are contained in blood, these entities are most often naturally found where blood was spilled in large enough amounts that a person's soul might get anchored to that location. Individuals might attempt to collect enough blood in order to trap a soul within a container, allowing them to take the soul with them. Followers of [[Styvel]] and [[Mahys]] looked down upon this practice, and often set out with the purpose of freeing these trapped souls.

## Intelligent/Sentient Ghosts

When Ghosts are combined with a compatible spirit, they form what scientists call 'sentient ghosts', in that the soul is then able to mimic the living individual in every way except the physical.
