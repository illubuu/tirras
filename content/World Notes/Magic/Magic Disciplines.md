The magic in Tirras Savehys is divided up into multiple categories, based on either the function or outcome of spells.

## Lyzsnry

Lyzsnry magic is Devil's magic, only able to be cast by [[Devils]] or those with pacts with them. Because lyzsnry focuses on the Flame, most spells act as fire spells.
## Necromancy

Necromancy is magic that centers around the manipulation of the four Aspects of Life, specifically spirit and soul. It is practiced by both [[Mahys]] and [[Styvel]], as well as their followers in their funerary rituals. It is also a natural phenomena and key aspect of the [[Dies Lin Du Forest]], being this magic's [[Spigots|Spigot]]. 
## Chronomancy

Chronomancy is magic that centers around the manipulation of time and individual's perception of it. It is one of the most complex forms of magic and can only be taught by the [[Fae]], whose magic alone can create these effects. 
### Mnemonic 

Mnemonic magic is the subgenre of time magic involving the containment of a memory (more specifically, a moment in time) inside of a 'bubble' to be viewed at a later date. While it stems from [[Fae]] magic, it is more associated with the [[Oudinnen]], as their culture centers around this ability. 
## Phrenory

Phrenory mafic focuses on the mind and its manipulation, including suggestion, charm, and emotional pull. It is usually utilized to aid individuals with mental illnesses but can be done with nefarious intentions. It is practiced by [[Fhewhas]], and its Spigot is the [[Myoh Lake Oasis]]. 
## Elemental

Elemental magic focuses on the magical manipulation of the elements found in nature: fire, water, air, ground, lightning, thunder and metal. This magic focuses on the movement and the utility of the elements, both in creation and already existing forms. It is practiced by [[Idallouse]] and [[Lihsek]]. Its Spigot is [[Two Sands]].
## Lexicory

Lexicory magic focuses on the written type of magic, such as glyphs, wards, seals, and runes. All magic used to be cast this wat, but as mages evolved most came to cast through arcane tolls (such as staves) or with the body itself. It is practiced by [[Hylehre]]. Its Spigot is the [[Mount Teii Laval Fields]]. 
## Selucory

Selucory magic is that which affects the physical aspects of the world (weight, speed, etc.) This magic operates on a 'tit for tat' where the attributes of one item are switched for another. It is practiced by [[Kere'unel]] and its Spigot is the [[Stoneward Tunnels]]. 
## Aethery

Aethery is magic that centers on the manipulation of living things (flora, fauna, etc.). This includes shapeshifting, and controlling plants and animals. Unlike necromancy, it does not involve resurrection, but does include healing magic. It is practiced by [[Aarmaen]] and its Spigot is [[Lake Ailmed]]. 
## Celestial

Celestial magic is the magic specific to the [[Seraphim]], and only usable by them and the [[Nephilin]]. Much of their magic is meant as a direct opposite to the lyzsn magic used by Devils. It also has healing capabilities, and is the only type that can heal lyzsn burns.
## Anti-Magic

Anti-magic is a magic that exists solely as an 'opposite' to magic. Its presence can negate all magic, save for that of the [[The Primordials]] (Chronomancy, Dragonic, and Abyssal). It can only be used by [[Verdihsil]] and his followers. Its Spigot is the [[Deadlands Archipelago]]. 

# Unconfirmed Disciplines
