Magic within the land of Tirras Savehys comes in many forms, most of which have been studied extensively and categorized for better understanding. The main forms of magic come in one of two ways, separated by their source: [[Magic Categories#Pact Magic|Pact Magic]] and [[Magic Categories#Non-Pact Magic|Non-Pact Magic]]. Non-Pact Magic is further separated by how the magic is learned: [[Magic Categories#Generational Magic|Generational Magic]], and [[Magic Categories#Learned Magic|Learned Magic]]. Lastly, there is [[Magic Categories#Fae (Nyortin) Magic| Fae Magic]].

## Pact Magic

Pact Magic is the most widespread source of magic in the world. Because is is the easiest to gain access to, and is highly regulated (at least in the case of the Nine and their subsidiaries), there is very little fear in the creation of these pacts. 

These pacts can be made between any mortal and any God or Godlike being, and can anything from a formal contract, written and signed (as seen with [[The Council#The Nine|the Nine]]), verbal agreements, accidental agreements, or curses (as often seen with [[Rogue Gods]] and [[Devils]]). Pact magic is viable for as long as the pact stands - if the pact is broken, the magic is released and the individual can no longer call upon it to cast.

### Godly Pacts

Pact Magic that is garnered from an agreement between a mortal and a God is both very uniform, sharing aspects with each other, while also maintaining a uniqueness to each God themselves. The magic cast from these pacts always share the color of the God they are calling upon, however *which* spells a caster can utilize are specific to each God (ie a pact with [[Idallouse]] would give access to specific sun based fire spells that no other caster can access). Some Gods are lenient and allow their magic to be used to cast 'non-domain' spells (such as those created by mages) while others are very strict and only allow their 'domain' spells to be used. It is often that these pacts to specific Gods/Lesser Gods are signed with specific job purposes in mind, and may even be a requirement for particular professions.

### Devil Pacts

Devil Pacts are unique in comparison to Godly Pacts as they are far from uniform, often incredibly variable in how they manifest for each individual. They, however, offer a far less restrictive access to magic for the user, and do not fall under the rules and regulations the Nine have established. The source of this type of magic is always the [[Lower Planes#Lyzsn Fire|fires]] and, as such, all spells cast have this effect active. This also enables the user to cast spells *specific to* their [[Devils|Devil]], spells that are not capable by any other means than a pact. (It is because of this feature than some arcane scholars refer to these type of spells as 'incantations'). Spells of this nature are limited when facing holy or celestial magic specifically. Additionally, due to the untempered nature of this magic, the use of it takes a toll on the individual's body, moreso than the other sources. 

## Non-Pact Magic

Non-Pact Magic is much rarer than its pact counterpart, as it is more difficult to manage and requires a certain amount of effort and education to be able to use. However, this magic also tends to be far more malleable, and allows for the creation of spells (rather than acting from a strict list) and gives the user more active control over magic as a whole.

These sources of magic can come from two places: magic housed within the blood (a generational bloodline, such as with [[Nephilin]]) or that which is practiced and learned from scratch (as with proper mages).

### Generational Magic

Generational Magic is magic that is kept within the bloodline of an individual, traced back to a singular being or person who tied themselves to magic itself, allowing it to be passed down from them. This can either be from a [[Seraphim|Seraph]], or a God (of any rank).

#### Celestials 

Celestial Magic is magic sourced from one of the four Grand Seraphim, and is unique to the race of [[Nephilin|Nephilins]] who inhabit Tirras Savehys. After the [[The Splintering|Splintering]], and the creation of the Seraphim, said celestial beings intermingled with the mortals of the physical plane, and bore children who inherited their parent's astral lineage. These children were tied to the [[Celestralarium]], and allowed them to commune with a single Seraph, who came to be known as [[Seraphim#Guardians|Guardians]]. However, due to the Seraphim's nature in being part of a worldly balance, not every child born in the bloodline was granted a Guardian. Instead, the bloodline simply allowed that child to be called upon should the balance tip. Similarly to Godly Magic, Celestial Magic has a unique color dependent on the Seraph the individual descends from; similarly to Devil Magic, there is additionally a collection of spells unique to the Nephilin and their Seraph (also called 'incantations' by some scholars). These are often associated with healing and protection (but not always).

#### Gods/Deities

Magic sourced from a Godly ancestor is distinct from a [[Demigods|Demigod]] in that they are not the children of Gods, but rather the children of children of Gods (thus, having either a Demigod parent, or a parent who themselves had such magic). Magic of this kind diminishes the further it is from the God it calls from, so many individuals who may be of a Godly bloodline would never be aware of it (even if they go on to practice magic). This also means that the specifics to a God that a Pact user might notice (such as color) would be diluted for a Godly ancestor.

### Learned Magic

Magic sourced through these means is not actually 'sourced' as much as it is 'learned.' The magic, instead, comes from the person themselves, harnessing their own power to facilitate their spells. This means that Learned Magic is the most mutable and the most powerful of all the magic types. However, this magic types also takes the longest to learn, being that one must not only learn to direct arcane energy, but *generate* it as well. These casters are properly titled 'mages', and tend to draw either awe or disdain for their abilities. Most of those who choose to learn this magic tend to become scholars or academics in the arcane sphere.
## Fae (Nyortin) Magic

This type of magic is the least well known of all the magic types, being that it is only utilized by the [[Fae]] people. Nyortin Magic - or Fae Magic - is the strongest time magic known to exist, able to manipulate both forward and backward as well as create 'time bubbles'. These time bubbles are the homes within which the Nyortin live (as time and existence outside the bubble weakens them to the point of death). Currently, it is only mages who can even begin to learn Fae magic, but even for them it is exceptionally difficult to do.
