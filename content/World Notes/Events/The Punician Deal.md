The Punician Deal was a bargain struck between [[Layleth]], Neornen Princess, and [[Essence of Four#Archdevils#Conquest|Ria]], the Archdevil of Conquest, in the former's attempt to murder the [[Fhewhas|God of Magic]] and usurp his place within the Nine.

## Layleth's Plan

Seeking revenge for her husband's refusal to grant her demigod status like that of her children, Layleth communed with the [[Lower Planes]] to contact one of the [[Essence of Four]]. Layleth offered one of these essences - Ria - a body with which to return to the physical plane if she aided her in her plans to murder Fhewhas. Ria, eager to be free of her confines, agreed and gifted Layleth a [[Seraph's Bane|special dagger]] that would enable her to be able to tear open the fabric between the physical plane and the astral plane, dragging Fhewhas though and killing him as one would any mortal.

Layleth drew in a number of her guards to aid her in this pursuit and, on the night of her attack, strode into her bed chamber to confront her husband and reign herself Goddess of Magic.

Unbeknownst to her, however, her plans had been thwarted and Fhewhas stood waiting for her. In her panic, she attempted to use the blade to merge the planes, but the minute it touched the air, there was a grand explosion from the very top of the Palace Spire that colored the sky purple. The tear spilled raw, uncontrolled arcane into the world and created what became known as the [[Great Catastrophe]].
