It took weeks for the magic to spread across the land, some scholars believing that it took approximately a month for the effects of the arcane to reach from the Eastern Continent to the farthest west lands of [[The Great Plains|the Plains]] and [[Kisnicanzadantis]]. There is speculation that there must be some sort of large mountain range or landmark on the eastern edge of the Eastern Continent that prevented the magic spillage from hitting those western lands early (as magic spreads evenly from its source).

The actual effects of the arcane are difficult to pinpoint, simply because the knowledge of what the world was prior is all but unknown. Scientists have a difficult time working out whether what stands today is a result of the explosion or had truly existed before, since everything carries traces of the magic from the initial explosion. The current assumptions are that the magic killed nearly all life that currently existed in the world (some estimates place it at almost 80%), and decimated most civilizations into obscurity.
