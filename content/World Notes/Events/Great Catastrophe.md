The Great Catastrophe was a cataclysmic event that destroyed nearly all life within Tirraes Savehys, but made extinct the [[Neorn]] People that ruled the [[Ancient Kingdom]]. 

## Lead Up to Destruction

The Neornen Kingdom was a technological and arcane wonder, with much of their advancement and success because their Princess and current monarch, [[Layleth]], had worked to impress the God of Magic, [[Fhewhas]], enough that he decided to take her as a mortal bride. Their coupling allowed the Kingdom to flourish, with magical advancements far beyond what would be normally capable, and produced three children, all of whom were ranked [[Demigods]].

Her children's position as deities, however, angered Layleth as she herself was still mortal. A very powerful mortal, but a mortal nonetheless. She had repeatedly asked Fhewhas to grant her the title and place of demigod, but he each time refused her. Years passed and their relationship soured until one day, Layleth grew tired of being subservient to a God who granted her nothing and planned [[The Punician Deal|her revenge]]. 

In the failure of her plan, Fhewhas released mass amounts of arcane from the astral plane to that of the physical plane, destroying not only the Eastern Continent, but that of most life that currently existed in the world. 

## Aftermath

It took weeks for the magic to spread across the land, some scholars believing that it took approximately a month for the effects of the arcane to reach from the Eastern Continent to the farthest west lands of [[The Great Plains|the Plains]] and [[Kisnicanzadantis]]. There is speculation that there must be some sort of large mountain range or landmark on the eastern edge of the Eastern Continent that prevented the magic spillage from hitting those western lands early (as magic spreads evenly from its source).

The actual effects of the arcane are difficult to pinpoint, simply because the knowledge of what the world was prior is all but unknown. Scientists have a difficult time working out whether what stands today is a result of the explosion or had truly existed before, since everything carries traces of the magic from the initial explosion. The current assumptions are that the magic killed nearly all life that currently existed in the world (some estimates place it at almost 80%), and decimated most civilizations into obscurity.
