The Splintering was an event in [[1. Times Before Memory|Times Before Memory]] when the Archdevils, rebellious [[Dragons]] who (with the help of the [[Fae|Fae]]) shed their immortal scales and attempted to retake control of the new world. The Grand Seraphim, created by the [[The Primordials#The Void|Void]] and empowered with the Abyss, attempted to keep them from doing so. 

## Early Years



When the [[Spigots]] birthed into the world the New Gods, the Old Races of the Dragons and the Fae struggled against them for claim in the world. There was the belief among the Old Races that they had a permanent claim to the world, and that the New Races were none other than usurpers. 
## The Fellows

The Fellows were mortals who sided with the [[Essence of Four#Archdevils|Archdevils]] during the war. Either through manipulation with promises of power, or cruel possession and subjugation, there were mortals who fought against their own kind under the Lyzsn banner.

These individuals would later become the [[Keepers of the Flame]].
